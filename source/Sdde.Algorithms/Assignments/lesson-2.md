1. Write a function to find the intersection of two arrays using the linear traversal (2 pointer) approach.
Your algorithm should take in two arrays and return an array containing all shared values between the two arrays (or an empty array if no values intersect)
Assume the input arrays given are not sorted

2. Write a solution to the 2 sum problem
Your function should take in an an array of integers, and a target sum.
Assume the input array is not sorted
It should return a pair of indices: If any two numbers in the input add up to the target sum, return the pair of indices of those numbers. If there are no such numbers, then return the pair (-1, -1)
